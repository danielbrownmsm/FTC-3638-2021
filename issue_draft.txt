Problem: motor on expansion hub will revert to zeroPowerBehavior.BRAKE after losing connection with the control hub then reconnecting. Setting it to zeroPowerBehavior.FLOAT doesn't change this, but also doesn't throw an error.

RC: (Control Hub) OS v. 1.1.2, Android v. 7.1.2, Expansion Hub v. 1.8.2, RC v. 6.1 with an extra expansion hub connected through the RS485 port
DS: moto e5 play android v. 8.0 running DS v. 6.1
